{start}
???: So...another one has been caught by the trap.
Esionem: Ah! Who are you!?
???: Just merchant with many wares for sale.
	Sens, is he lieing?	{sens check}
	How can we be so sure? {player check}
	What do you have in stock? {explain_wares}

{sens_check}
Sens: I can't really tell, but I don't feel malice in his heart. Not much, anyway. [sens_up] {player check}

{player_check}
Merchant: You can only trust me. You are without eyes, so you are without choice.
Esionem: How do you know that?
Merchant: I have not lost my eyes, unlike most who find themselves here. You see, I have exchanged my liberty for my eyes. They are such a valuable asset, you know. But do not let my past bother you. There is much I can do for you. [set checked_merchant] [if talked_to_merchant, {wares}, {explain_wares}]

{explain_wares}
Merchant: If you wish, I can identify items for you. Or if you find yourself lacking some tool or trinket, I may be able to furnish you with it. I also possess some knowledge of the caverns which you may find invaluable. All for the right amount of coin. mind you. Oh, and I am will to part with my gold if something of yours catches my eye. {wares}

{wares}
Shall we conduct buisness? [set talked_to_merchant]
	What do you have in stock?
	I have some extra things which may interest you.
	Can you tell me what this thing is?
	I'm looking for some info about an area.
	[if not checked,
		How can I be sure that you can be trusted? {player_check},
	 else if not explained_eyes,
		You said before that you could see...didn't you? {explain_eyes}]
	That will be all. {leave}

{explain_eyes}
Merchant: That is correct. As you probably know, all living creatures that stay in this place for long are doomed to lose their eyes and become blind. You are no exception.
Esionem: But why aren't you blind, then? Wait...you said living creatures, didn't you? Does that make you...a ghost? Please don't tell me you're dead!
Sens: Stop with the conspiricies. If we was dead, I would know.
Merchant: Your blue friend raises a good point. I am, however, among the living. I have made a deal with the master of this place. In exchange for my eyes, I must remain behind these bars. Breaking free voids the deal, and I will be subject to your terrible fate.
Esionem: Master...of this place? Why would you deal with him? He...he...
	Do you know him, Esio?
	Sir, where can I find this 'master'?
	Why would do you prefer being locked up instead of being blind?
	Thank you for the explanation, sir.
